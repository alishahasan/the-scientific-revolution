# the-scientific-revolution
A simple text-based game walking the player through the scientific revolution.

This game was created using Bitsy by Adam Le Doux. The tool I used to make this game can be found [here](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy).

The controls are simple: WASD / arrow keys will work to move around. Approach the flashing boxes with an exclamation point in them to learn more about the area you're in, and go to the swirling icons to enter another room.

Enjoy!
